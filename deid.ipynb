Her pericardial fluid was accumulated\n","and she was seen by Dr. Y. At that time, she was recommended for pericardectomy, which was\n","performed by Dr. Z. Review of her CT scan from March 2006 prior to her pericardectomy,\n","already shows bilateral plural effusions. The patient improved clinically after the\n","pericardectomy with resolution of her symptoms.

Her <PER>n was placed on hold. A repeat echocardiogram was checked. She was started\\non prophylaxis for <MISC>T with <PER>x 40 mg subcutaneously. Her history dated back to March\\n2005 when she first sought medical attention for evidence of pericarditis, which was treated\\nwith pericardial window in an outside hospital, at that time she was also found to have\\nmesenteric pain and thrombosis, is now anticoagulated. Her pericardial fluid was accumulated\\nand she was seen by Dr. Y. At that time, she was recommended for pericardectomy, which was\\nperformed by Dr. Z. Review of her <ORG>T scan from March 2006 prior to her pericardectomy,\\nalready shows bilateral plural effusions. The patient improved clinically after the\\npericardectomy with resolution of her symptoms. Recently, she was readmitted to the hospital\\nwith chest pain and found to have bilateral pleural effusion, the right greater than the left. <ORG>T\\nof the chest also revealed a large mediastinal lymph node. We reviewed the pathology obtained\\n\\f\\nfrom the pericardectomy in March 2006, which was diagnostic of mesothelioma. At this time,\\nchest tube placement for drainage of the fluid occurred and thoracoscopy with fluid biopsies,\\nwhich were performed, which revealed epithelioid malignant mesothelioma. The patient was\\nthen stained with a <ORG>T, which showed extensive uptake in the chest, bilateral pleural\\npericardial effusions, and lymphadenopathy. She also had acidic fluid, pectoral and\\nintramammary lymph nodes and uptake in L4 with SUV of 4. This was consistent with stage II\\ndisease. Her repeat echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 45% to 49%. She was\\ntransferred to <ORG>y service and started on chemotherapy on September 1, 2007 with\\ncisplatin 75 mg/centimeter squared equaling 109 mg <PER>V piggyback over 2 hours on September\\n1, 2007, <PER>a 500 mg/ centimeter squared equaling 730 mg <PER>V piggyback over 10 minutes.\\nThis was all initiated after a <MISC>h was placed. The chemotherapy was well tolerated and\\nthe patient was discharged the following day after discontinuing IV fluid and <PER>V.
